ROUTE53 
 
FOR DEPLOYING APPLICATION  
 
STEP A) : CREATE A VPC 
 
•	IN VPC WE HAVE DIFFERENT SUBNETS  IN DIFFERENT AVAILABILITY ZONES. 
•	SUPPOSE WE DEPLOY APPLICATION IN 2 SEVEERS 
•	ONE IP ADDRESS IS 1.2.4.6 
•	AND OTHER IS 9.8.4.2 
•	WE CREATE LOAD BALANCER TO ROUTE TRAFFIC TO TWO SERVERS. 
•	WHEN WE CREATE LB WE GET LB DNS. 
•	IF THE USERS WANT TO ACCESS THE APPLICATION WE DIDN’T GIVE THEM PUBLIC IP OR LB DNS. 
•	INSTEAD OF THAT WE GIVE THEM DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) TO THE USERS.SO USERS CAN ACCESS THE APPLICATION USING THAT DNS NAME. 
WHAT IS DNS? 
A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human readable names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.  
The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and numbers. 
 DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser.  
These requests are called queries.

•	IN REAL LIFE WE ACCESS THE APPLICATION LIKE AMAZON ,SWIGGY,ZOMATO BY USING DNS NAMES INSTEAD OF IP ADDRESS. 
FOR AMAZON DNS NAME IS:amazon.in 
FOR SWIGGY DNS NAME IS:swiggy.com

* Big rock                 https://www.bigrock.in/     
STEP 1: BUY DNS IN THE GO DADDY OR ANY OTHER DOMAIN PURCHASE PLATFORMS. 
•	SEARCH FOR DOMAIN NAMES

•	MAKE PAYMENT.AND BUY THE DOMAIN 
•	IN MY CASE I BOUGHT THE DOMAIN NAME  
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49c2e5b5-51ee-4009-9574-eb39ec56d9a1)

 
•	DOMAIN NAME:  bloodbanklife.in.net 
 
STEP 2: GO TO AWS CONSOLE AND SEARCH FOR ROUTE53 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5c86b3d-3ed3-4225-b5d1-55455091e366)

 
AWS ALSO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF SERVICE TO BUY DOMAINS FOR THIS THEY 
LAUCHED SERVICE NAMED AS “ROUTE53” 
  
 
•	We search for available domain names and we need to buy that domains. 
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5af0d713-e2ae-4def-9f30-7823033ac9e4)
  
 
•	WE CAN ALSO CONFIGURE THIRD PARTY DNS ( WHICH BROUGHT FROM OTHER DOMAIN NAME PROVIDER COMPANIES). 
STEP 3: IN MY CASE I CONFIGURE THE DNS NAME WHICH I BROUGHT FROM BIG ROCK. 
•	BEFORE CONFIGURE THIS.CREATE A EC2 INSTANCE(UBUNTU) AND INSTALL APACHE 2 WEB SERVER AND DEPLOY SIMPLE APP. 
•	CREATE A INSTANCE. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea9323e-520d-4be6-9e92-fa9f2b70cfe8)
  
•	CONNECT TO EC2 INSTANCE,UPDATE AND INSTALL APACHE2 WEBSERVER 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/094344de-cfdc-472e-b4a9-17eccbeacc8b)
  
•	TO CHECK THE STATUS OF WEBSERVER 
              systemctl status apache2
